This script ignores a The SIGINT signal by registering SIG_IGN as the handler.

This script replaces the default handler for SIGINT with SIG_IGN, and registers a handler for SIGUSR1. Then it uses signal.pause() to wait for a signal to be received.


Normally SIGINT (the signal sent by the shell to your program when you hit Ctrl-C) raises a KeyboardInterrupt. In this example, we ignore SIGINT and raise SystemExit when we see SIGUSR1. Each ^C represents an attempt to use Ctrl-C to kill the script from the terminal.


Open two terminals. In one run the script and try to Ctrl-C and close the program.
In the other run
kill -USR1 $pidDisplayed
